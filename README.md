# Project Title: Chicago Crime Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of crime incident data from Chicago, spanning from 2001 to the present. The project uses Python, pandas, and matplotlib to clean the raw data, analyze trends, and visualize key findings.

### Project Objective

The main goal of this analysis is to uncover significant patterns and trends within the Chicago crime dataset. The project answers key questions, such as:

* What are the most common types of crimes?
* How have crime rates changed over time?
* How do the number of homicides with an arrest compare to the total number of homicide incidents?
* How does the arrest rate vary between different types of crimes, such as robbery and narcotics offenses?

### Dataset

The analysis is based on the "Crimes - 2001 to Present" dataset, which is a public dataset provided by the City of Chicago. Due to its large size, the dataset is managed using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS).

### Repository Contents

* `crime.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* `Crimes_-_2001_to_Present.csv`: The raw dataset used for the analysis.
* `homicide_arrest_chart.png`: A saved visualization comparing homicide incidents to the number of arrests.
